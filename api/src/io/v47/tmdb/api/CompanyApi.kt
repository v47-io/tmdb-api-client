     * There are two image formats that are supported for companies, PNG's and SVG's.
     * You can see which type the original file is by looking at the `file_type` field.
     * We prefer SVG's as they are resolution independent and as such, the width and
     * height are only there to reflect the original asset that was uploaded. An SVG
     * can be scaled properly beyond those dimensions if you call them as a PNG.
     *
     * For more information about how SVG's and PNG's can be used, take a read through
     * [this document](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/images)
